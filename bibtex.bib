  note      = {The authors of the paper represent mechanisms to convert distributed graph algorithm
               for dynamic graphs. In the paper, they provided two classic graph problem \textit{(degree+1)-vertex coloring}
	       and \textit{maximal independent set(MIS)}. In their work, the only think about edge insertion and deletion rather than
	       vertex. If there are no edges in a vertex then they treat it as a inactive vertex.}
